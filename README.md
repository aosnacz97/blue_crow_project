# blue_crow_project
A demo project for Blue Crow Sports Group

### What are is that csv? 
# data.csv 
This is the sample athlete data provided to me from Blue Crow.

### What is that R file?
That is the processing script I used to manipulate the data into being how I wanted it for the app. Everything I do in there should be detailed in comments!

### What about those folders?

# Blue Crow Dash Folder
This is the folder that I put the R Shiny app in. The "www" folder within it contains all media used in the app (pictures, gifs, etc.).
App.R is the actual script that creates the dash's UI and server. 
individual_athletes_data_final.csv is all processed athlete data.
norms.csv is norms against all data, norms_pos.csv is norms by position, norms_hand.csv is norms by laterality, norms_age is norms by age group.

# error_log_folder
This is simply where I dump any errors from the processing script so I can look back and see what may have gone wrong.
